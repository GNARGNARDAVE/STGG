					<p>It's been a while since I have done any coding on my own. This site utilizes Jekyll, JavaScript, Google
						Material, Sass, and some other to be determined libraries/frameworks. I may utilize a little React and
					some Angular.</p>
					<p>It all started in 1995 with seven or eight 3.5 inch disks that contained a little program called PhotoShop.  Microsoft Frontpage helped me learn HTML in 1996.  And the rest is history.</p>

				<p>This whole site is one big experiment and learning tool for myself.  I'll add some examples on features I have built in the past.  There are elements from other apps/sites that
				I cherry pick from.</p>
				<p>So while it's not a total experimental site where you can cut and paste examples from, to use on your site, maybe it can help give you ideas on how to
				approach the interactions you can have on your app.</p>
