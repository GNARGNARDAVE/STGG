There's nothing more that I hate is seeing a recipe that has a time frame around it.
10 minute meal, they say. 20 minute meal, they say. Bullshit.

This can be served as is with rice or can be served with any sauce.
Instead of rice, you could get the instant basmati rice (microwave bag),
some tikki masala sauce jar, and naan bread to change it up. The microwaveable
basmati rice drastically reduces overall cook time, so if you were in a bind
and needed to cook dinner, having a few jars on hand of whatever sauce you have
and a few bags of the basmati rice comes in handy with some chicken thighs.

#### Meat
2 lbs of Chicken Thighs

#### Spices
Salt<br/>
Pepper

#### Produce
3 Cloves of Garlic<br/>
1 Red pepper - sliced<br/>
1 White Onion - sliced<br/>

#### Sauces
Sesame Oil<br/>
Tikki Masala - Optional

#### Starch
Rice

### Prep
Take the chicken thighs and season both sides with salt and pepper.
Season the pan with sesame oil and toss in the garlic cloves on medium
heat. Cook the rice before you prep and cook 2-3 cups of rice depending on
the number of people eating.  It takes about 20-25 minutes in a rice cooker,
so plan accordingly so you don't have to wait.

### Cook
Get another pan and season it with sesame oil on  medium heat. Toss in the
sliced peppers and onions and cook until soft (or to your liking).

Throw in the chicken thighs and look at the thighs until they are cooked halfway
through. Flip them, and depending on how much oil you have put into the
pan, it may have a crispy texture.

If you have kitchen shears, cut up the chicken to help it cook faster.

Toss in the veggies when the chicken is almost done.

### Optional
You can buy tikki masala sauce, or butter chicken sauce and pour it into
the pan after the chicken is ready. Toss the sauce with the chicken and serve.
