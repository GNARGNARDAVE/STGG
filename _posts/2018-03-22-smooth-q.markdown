With all the gimbals out there - I invested in a Kickstarter for the
Steadicam Volt. What I failed to realize was how it worked - it wasn't
good for something like snowboarding, only for following around folks on foot.

So I started looking at gimbals, and found this one on Amazon for $99.

There are not a lot of videos snowboarding with the [Zhiyun Smooth Q](https://amzn.to/2pDRr1k){:target="_blank"}. I used this
with the Google Pixel 2. The one I bought came with a GoPro adapter (I have
the [GoPro 3](https://amzn.to/2DU3pbA):{target="_blank"}) but
the issue was that it doesn't support the waterproof case.  The Google Pixel 2
is waterproof so I went with that instead.

It was great - other than the times it got knocked loose by accident and
I had to turn it off and on again.  It connected to the app pretty good,
so it was nice to utilize the  button on the handle to record.

It handled pretty well I felt, I have to get used to the different
settings to take advantage of it. I didn't quite read the instructions,
and so there were times when I wanted to point it up or down, but i kept
the camera level.

More reviews to come later with it.  Towards the end we were about five
beers deep so please excuse the falling down and being stupid part.
